# Scan-Open-ports
 Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand  network exposure using nmap and using Wireshark to capture and analyze packet


This project demonstrates the use of Nmap and Wireshark for basic network reconnaissance and analysis.

-Conducted a TCP SYN scan with Nmap to identify open ports on a target system.
-Recorded and documented the open ports discovered during the scan.
-Utilized Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets generated during the scanning process.
-Gained an understanding of the potential security risks associated with open ports, including how they can be exploited if left unmonitored.

This repository includes the scan results and sanitized packet captures for learning and demonstration purposes.
